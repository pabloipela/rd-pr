  ## Bio
  I have been the CEO and co-founder of Plain Concepts as well as a Microsoft
  Regional Director for more than 15 years.
  
  I co-founded Plain Concepts in 2006 with other two MVPs (Microsoft Most
  Valuable Professionals) and today we have offices in Seattle, London, Dubai,
  Madrid, Bilbao, Barcelona, Seville and Leon.
  
  Plain Concepts’ mission is to provide innovative and engaging custom solutions
  for all types of digital needs whilst always incorporating the latest
  available technology. This is achieved thanks to our Microsoft MVPs, a
  Microsoft Regional Director, and certified ALM professionals & trainers. Our
  whole workforce is comprised of highly recognized professionals who either
  teach or speak at large renowned events or participate in industry forums
  whilst working together to innovate and progress.
  
  Currently, there are more than 130 people at Plain Concepts all with very high
  technical abilities. We are really a family of techies, and count on 12 MVPs
  and several MSPs.
  
  Plain Concepts has a broad portfolio of projects to support our expertise:
  mobile apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, web technology, enterprise
  applications, customized backend solutions, Xbox One and Xbox 360 media apps,
  Business Intelligence, Big Data, and all with a clear focus on cutting-edge
  innovation.
  
  Our customers are varied and cover the tourism & hospitality industry, media,
  telecommunications, banking, communications and entertainment, creative
  agencies and large enterprises such as Acciona, Telefonica, Vodafone or
  Microsoft, with whom we collaborate yearly on numerous local and global
  projects.
  
  In parallel, the team has collaborated with Microsoft in many global forums
  and events, acting as the reference within their technical specialties.
  
  Plain Concepts is a Microsoft Certified Gold Partner and this year, Plain
  Concepts won the Microsoft Partner of the Year in Spain and were a global
  finalist in the area of Data Platform.
  
  Plain Concepts also offers virtual reality services such as our flagship
  product PlainVR which allows you to view and enjoy virtual reality images and
  videos in 2D or 3D on any mobile device with Cardboard. We are also working on
  several Hololens projects with our own 3D Engine: Wave Engine
